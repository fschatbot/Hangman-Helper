Ever felt like playing hangman is hard? Do you want to cheat in the game? Well look no futher cause you stumbled on the right repo!

## Where can I find it

You can find this site hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://fschatbot.github.io/Hangman-Helper/)! This site is automaticially deployed on the most recent commit so you never miss a new version! As of 25/3/2022, the site features over 670,000 words.

## How does it work?

First we run [`scrap.py`](scrap.py) which scrapes over 6 dictionaries and stores them in `words` folder. Then based on the inputs given by the user on the site the program loops though all the words and find the most matching ones possible.

## Why did I do it?

Cause of an incident in school where I said that I could guess any word in hangman with the help of internet and ended up taking 16 guesses before I got the word right.
